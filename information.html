        for people ages 10-24. It accounted for the <b>loss of more than 45,979 American lives</b> in 2020, nearly <b>
            double</b> the number of lives lost to homicide. (Mental Health Myths and Facts | MentalHealth.gov, n.d.)

        myths</b> led to mental health disorders getting <b>more common</b> among individuals.
    <br /> <br />Thus, this website wishes to <b>raise awareness</b> on the <b>problem</b> of <b>mental health
